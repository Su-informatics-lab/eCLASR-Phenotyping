    description: >
      Pivot the vital sign results so that there is one record per patient and two
      columns per cutoff date: whether all of the values were normal—and thus fall
      under the exclusion criteria—and the most recent evidence date for that conclusion.
    columns:
      - name: patient_num
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
